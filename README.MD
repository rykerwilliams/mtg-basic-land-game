# The Basic Land Game
There are two variants of the game. One uses the Classic Rules and only the original 5 basic land types. Modern Rules use all the basic land types.

*103.4*. The normal staring hand size is 5.

*305.1* Playing a land casts it and uses the stack.

*402.2* The normal maximum hand size is 5.

*7045.y* If a player controls five or more basic lands with the same name, that player wins the game.

*704.5z* If a player controls six or more basic lands with different names, that player wins the game.
